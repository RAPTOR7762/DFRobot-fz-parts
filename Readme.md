# DFRobot Fritzing-library

This is the Official DFRobot [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/) library.

If you would like to just use the parts then just download 

    DFRobot_fritzing_library.fzbz

and import the parts bin into Fritzing (File -> Open...), or you can double-click the file (provided you have associated .fzbz with the fritzing app)

Please go to the [Fritzing Forum Parts Help Category](https://forum.fritzing.org/c/parts-help) to request for new parts. **Fill up the template** and you are good to go.

Please give us feedback. Let us/the [fritzing forum](https://forum.fritzing.org) know if there are any bugs. We will promptly make any necessary updates.
